I developed a comprehensive project in Excel, creating multiple dashboards and tables to analyze the data. This process involved several stages ,including data preprocessing ,data cleaning, and data visualization.

##Process

-Verify data for any missing values and anomalies, and sort out the same.

-Made sure data is consistent and clean with respect to data type,data format and values used.

-Created pivot tables according to the questions asked.

-Merge all pivot tables into one dashboard and apply slicer to make dynamic.
